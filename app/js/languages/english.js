    text: `Friends of Metal Magic Festival exists in order to support the continuous execution of and spread word about the Metal Magic Festival.

          This means that when you become a member of the organization, you are part of the efforts to ensure that the festival survives, grows and keeps attracting big and exclusive acts.

          Funds from membership fees and other sources of income are channelled directly to the festival, once the organization's expenses have been covered. We strive to keep our expenses to a minimum - in this way, the largest possible amount of funds received from you members are used directly to support the Metal Magic Festival.`,
